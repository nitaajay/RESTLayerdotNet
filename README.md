# REST Layer using C#.Net

This project shows a simplistic way to create REST API using Web API 2 framework. It uses trusted SQL backend connction. Models are used as representative objects that directly map to DB tables for simplicity and achieving home grown ORM. 

The inference is in creating a simple solution that can be replicated with minimal effort for creating a direct SQL query based REST middleware.
